\begin{itemize}
	\item We show performance on the ``big tasks''(TIMIT, yearpred, CovType, Census, Adult).
	\item We explain these results in terms of the ``small tasks'' (Census and Subsampled CovType), where we measure $\Delta$, showing that below a certain number of bits, $\Delta$ can increase a lot.  If we have space, we explain the trade-offs here a bit, showing in the fixed design setting that higher noise means higher $\lambda^*$, which means fewer bits can be used until $\Delta$ increases a lot.
	\item We briefly present low-precision training, showing that performance doesn't degrade much relative to full-precision training.
