In this section, we compare the performance of LP-RFFs with FP-RFFs, circulant FP-RFFs, and the \Nystrom method, on the TIMIT, YearPred, CovType, and Census datasets, showing that we can attain compression ratios of at least \todo{4x} relative to these methods, without hurting generalization performance. We then perform a more careful analysis of these results on the Census dataset, and a sub-sampled version of the CovType dataset, where we plot the generalization performance of these approximation methods relative to their relative spectral distances.  We observe on both datasets that the spectral distance appears much more predictive of generalization performance than more standard metrics like the Frobenius and spectral norms of $K-\tK$.  We note that in our experiments, in order to avoid the risk of numerical precision issues (kernel ridge regression requires matrix inversion), we do all our full-precision experiments in 64 bits.  Nonetheless, we calculate the memory utilization of these experiments as if we used 32 bits, to avoid inflating the relative gains of our method over the full precision approaches.

For all our experiments, we use the Gaussian kernel with the kernel width value recommended by~\citet{may2017}, and compute the memory utilization as described in Section~\ref{subsec:memory_utils}. To evaluate the performance of these kernel models, we measure the classification error for classification tasks, and the mean squared error (MSE) for regression tasks ($\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (f_{\tK}(x_i) - y_i)^2$), on the heldout set. We include more details about our datasets, experimental protocols, and hyperparameter choices in Appendix~\ref{sec:exp_details}.

\subsection{Empirical evaluation of LP-RFFs}
We compare the generalization performance of LP-RFFs to full-precision RFFs (FP-RFFs), circulant RFFs, and \Nystrom features, across four datasets, for various memory budgets.  We sweep the following hyperparameters: For LP-RFFs, we choose the precision $b \in \{1,2,4,8,16\}$. For \Nystrom, we use $m \in \{1250, 2500, 5000, 10000, 20000\}$.  For the RFF-based methods, we use $m\in \{1250, 2500, 5000, 10000, 20000, 50000, 100000, 200000, 400000\}$.  We choose these limits differently because $\num[group-separator={,}]{20000}$ \Nystrom features have roughly the same memory footprint as $\num[group-separator={,}]{400000}$ FP-RFFs. We avoid the prohibitively large computational expense of performing a grid search to tune the initial learning rate, the regularizer, the learning rate decay, and the number of training epochs, by using the heldout set in order to determine learning rate decay \citep{morgan1990generalization,sainath2013b,sainath2013low}. The scheme works as follows: at the end of each epoch, we decay the learning rate in half if the heldout performance is less than $1\%$ better relative to the previous best model, using MSE for regression and cross entropy for classification. Furthermore, if the model performs \textit{worse} than the previous best, we revert the model. The training terminates after the learning rate has been decayed 10 times. Early stopping can be seen as a form of regularization \citep{zhang2005boosting,wei2017early}.  We use a single initial learning rate per dataset across all experiments, which we tune via grid search using $20\text{k}$ \Nystrom features. We choose to use \Nystrom features to tune the initial learning rate in order to avoid biasing the results in favor of RFF-based approaches. 

In Figure \ref{fig:generalization_col}, we plot the generalization performance for all these experiments, as a function of the amount of memory used, as well as the number of features $m$. We show across all four datasets that LP-RFFs show systematically better generalization performance than the full precision baselines under different memory budget. Importantly, we can observe that the \Nystrom method has observably better generalization performance than LP-RFF and FP-RFF-based baselines under the same number of features. However, when we instead consider performance as a function of memory utilization, the opposite it true, with the RFF-based methods demonstrating superior generalization performance. This observation further validates the practical importance of comparing kernel approximation methods under memory budgets.

In Table~\ref{tab:mem_saving} we present the compression ratios we can achieve with LP-RFF, relative to the baselines, while still attaining generalization performance within $10^{-4}$ of the full-precision baseline.  We measure this as follows:  For each baseline (FP-RFF, circulant FP-RFF, \Nystrom), we find the best performing (as well as median) model. We then find the smallest LP-RFF model, as well as the smallest baseline model, which attains within $10^{-4}$ relative performance to the best performing baseline.  We report the ratio of the memory used by these two models (baseline/LP-RFF), that are both within $10^{-4}$ of the best baseline. We compute this ratio across three independent runs using different random seeds, and report the average.  We can see that LP-RFFs demonstrate significant memory saving over FP-RFFs and circulant FP-RFFs, showing 2.9x-10.3x and 2.4x-15.6x compression ratios respectively. On the TIMIT dataset, there are 147 classes, and thus the full-precision learned parameters occupy a large portion of the total memory across all methods. Nonetheless, even though these LP-RFF experiments only quantize the feature mini-batches, they still attain 5.1x and 2.4x compression ratios relative to FP-RFF and circulant FP-RFF.

\subsubsection{Low precision training for LP-RFFs}
\label{sec:halp}
In this section, we demonstrate that LP-RFFs can be trained using 8-bit low precision HALP training algorithm. The generalization performance from 8-bit HALP training can closely match the performance from full-precision SGD training. We use the same learning rate schedule as the one in the SGD-based experiments. We sweep the $\mu$ parameter, which determines the value of the quantization scale in HALP, using grid search over $\{0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0\}$. For each number of LP-RFFs $m$, we choose the value of $\mu$ attaining lowest heldout classification error, and report this as the error. In Figure~\ref{fig:halp}, we can see that for 8-bit LP-RFFs, the generalization performance of the models trained with HALP can closely match the results from full-precision SGD, once the number of features exceed 10k. This shows, in scenarios where large numbers of kernel approximation features are required, we can safely train LP-RFFs with low precision training algorithms to reduce the memory footprint of training.

\subsection{Heldout performance vs. relative spectral distance}
In this section, our goal is to dig deeper into the strong generalization performance of LP-RFFs, by seeing whether these results can be understood in terms of the theory presented in Sections \ref{sec:genbound} and \ref{sec:lprff}.  In particular, the theory we presented bounds the generalization performance of the kernel approximation models using the relative spectral distance between the kernel approximation matrix, and the exact kernel matrix.  Although the theory as presented only applies to fixed design linear regression, in this section we ask whether relative spectral distance is predictive of generalization performance for non-fixed design kernel ridgre regression, as well as for kernel logistic regression.

We run experiments on the Census dataset, as well as on a sub-sampled version of the CovType dataset, where we select $20k$ training and heldout points at random.  The reason we use these smaller datasets is because computing the relative spectral distance is an expensive operation, which requires instantiating the kernel matrices fully, and performing singular value decompositions, which are expensive operations. For the Census dataset, we use the closed form solution for the kernel ridge regression estimator.  For CovType, because there is no closed form solution for logistic regression, we train the models with SGD using mini-batches of size 250; we pick the best initial learning rate, as well as regularization parameter, by using $20k$ \Nystrom features as a proxy for the exact kernel (note that because there are only $20k$ training points, this \Nystrom approximation is exact). For CovType, we pick the initial learning rate from the set $\{5, 10, 50, 100\}$, and for both tasks we pick the regularization parameter $\lambda \in \{1e^{-5}, 5e^{-5}, 1e^{-4}, 1e^{-3}, 5e^{-3}, 1e^{-2}, 5e^{-2}, 1e^{-1}\}$ which gives the best performance on the heldout set. We report the average $D_{\lambda}(K,\tK)$ and the average generalization performance, along with standard deviations, using 5 different random seeds.

In Figure~\ref{fig:specdist} (leftmost plots), we observe that LP-RFFs can achieve significantly smaller relative spectral distance $D_{\lambda}(K,\tK)$ than FP-RFFs and the \Nystrom method. Specifically, the 8 bit and 4 bit versions of LP-RFF attain the best relative spectral distance for Census and Covtype respectively. In this figure, we also show generalization performance vs. relative spectral distance (middle), as well as vs. the Frobenius norm of $K-\tK$ (right).  We can see that there is a strong correspondence between relative spectral distance and generalization performance across these methods, whereas for the Frobenius norm, the $\Nystrom$ method does not align well with the RFF-based methods. We observe a similar result with the spectral norm, and include these results in Appendix \todo{X}.
