\begin{itemize}
	\item Bound on new definition of $\Delta$ which holds for $\Delta > 1/2$.
	\item ``Matrix Log'': Thinking about why taking log of matrix is a good idea, and measuring $\|\log(\tK + \lambda * I) - \log(K + \lambda * I)\|$.
	\item $w,x,b$ low precision (from $cos(w'x + b)$)
	\item Laplacian kernel.
	\item An understanding of $\Delta$ for the \Nystrom method.
	\item Plotting speed vs. memory for \Nystrom vs. RFF.
