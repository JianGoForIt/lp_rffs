\begin{itemize}
	\item We introduce low-precision RFF \avner{Should we do this earlier, in a ``Methods'' section?}.
	\item We present our theoretical results about LP-RFF, bounding it's approximation error (maybe push this to appendix), and bounding it's $\Delta$, as a function of the number of quantized features, and the precision being used.
	\item We show our experiments, which have three parts: (1) Explore the performance on big tasks, (2) Explain trends on big experiments by doing detailed analysis on small tasks, (3) show low-precision training doesn't degrade performance much relative to FP training.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{LP-RFF: Method}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Present LP-RFF method in detail.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{LP-RFF: Theory}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Discuss bounds on kernel approximation performance (if we have space).
	\item Discuss bounds on $\Delta$.
\end{itemize}
