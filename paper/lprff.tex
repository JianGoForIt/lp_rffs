In this section, we present the details of low-precision random Fourier features (LP-RFFs), and provide our theoretical results, which lower bound the probability of $\tK$

\subsection{LP-RFF: Method}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Present LP-RFF method in detail: We use circulant RFF, we quantize features, and we optionally have low-precision model.
	\item Discuss the details of how we quantize.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{LP-RFF: Theory}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Discuss bounds on $\Delta$.
	\item Refer them to appendix for bound on kernel approximation error.
\end{itemize}
