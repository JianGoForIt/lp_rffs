Training high-performance kernel approximation models generally requires using a very large number of features; GPUs can be used for fast training, but have limited on-chip memory. To address this bottleneck, we investigate how to train kernel approximation models, which generalize well, under memory constraints. Motivated by recent theoretical work \citep{avron17,musco17}, we argue that generalization performance is intrinsically tied to the \emph{rank} of the approximate kernel matrix $\tK$. Thus, we propose using \emph{low-precision} random Fourier features (LP-RFFs) in order to generate a high-rank approximation, under a fixed memory budget. We prove a generalization bound for kernel ridge regression trained on these low-precision features. Our theoretical analysis shows that there exist regimes, where low-precision has a negligible effect on the number of features required to achieve a certain guarantee on generalization performance. Empirically, we demonstrate that LP-RFFs can match the generalization performance of both full-precision RFFs and the \Nystrom method, while using 4x-30x and 50x-435x less memory, respectively.
